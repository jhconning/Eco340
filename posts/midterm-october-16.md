To see your midterm exam score and an indicative grade first go to the Blackboard
 site for our course, click on 'My Grades' on the left navigation bar and write down 
 the 'midterm_tot', 'mc', and 'ps' scores. Next look at the document [midterm grading explained](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yz8Zt88NQl-mA0niBZ59OE4Z2pDJ7wbBM1ddc9DxjXA/edit?usp=sharing)
 for more details and explanations.
 
### Study material for the midterm
Covers all material covered through class on Thursday October 12th.  
Use the [lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OdIEQEIuW6WwHo8mO6LCW3F0MsQ2yfdJdReE6n0Cq2Y/edit?usp=sharing) 
as a guide to topics up thorugh the 
Stolper-Samuelson Theorem in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model. In 
terms of the textbook we've covered chapters 1-3 and most of chapter 4.

I've placed a [practice midterm](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Z0VAlMmIEpeV9uaFFBZTdJQTg) 
and [answers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Z0VAlMmIEpbk1IRFJiUXRDazg) online
which should give you a good idea of the topics and format.

During the exam you will only need a pencil an an eraser. 
A ruler may be helpful but not required. No calculators or phones allowed.
