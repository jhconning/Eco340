Here are links for in-class audience response.  
Some of these will be anonymous and others will be for participation credit. 

You will *not* be required to sign into any type of account to answer 
these polls but I will ask for your student EMPLID to apply credit in the
participation questions, so keep it handy. 
 
Polls with an `(A)` in front are anonymous while those with an `(E)' require
you to enter an EMPLID.


When prompted please click on the appropriate form link and answer only then.
